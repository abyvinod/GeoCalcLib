This file is part of the geometric calculation library.

The geometric calculation library uses David Avis' [LRS library][lrs], 
to compute the vertex enumeration of a polyhedral set P = {x: A*x<=b}.  It also
computes the facet enumeration to P = conv(V) + cone(R).  It has a function to
compute the projection of a polyhedron, as well as reduction functions to obtain
minimal representations of both V and H-representations of polyhedra.

INSTALL:
The geometric calculation library offers an interface to Matlab for all
its functionality. It requires the GMP library.

Create a text file named User.make containing the variables MATLABROOT and
INSTALLDIR (optionally you might need GMPINCLUDE) which provide the absolute
path to your Matlab installation and to the desired installation directory
respectively (and the location of the GMP header `gmp.h`).

Run 
```	
	make
```

You should now be able to run the mex files from Matlab.
